# boot.dev Learning Journey

Welcome to my learning repository! This repo documents my journey learning programming through [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/), an online platform focused on backend development education.

## About This Repository

This repository contains code, exercises, and projects I've completed while learning programming fundamentals and backend development through boot.dev's curriculum.

## Languages Learned

### Python

Python is where my programming journey began. Through boot.dev's Python courses, I've learned:

- Core Python syntax and fundamentals
- Data structures and algorithms
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Functional programming concepts
- Working with files and data

### Go

Go (Golang) is the second language I've learned, expanding my backend development skills. Topics covered include:

- Go syntax and conventions
- Concurrency with goroutines and channels
- Building web servers and APIs
- Static typing and compilation
- Go's approach to error handling

## Course Progress

This repository will grow as I continue through the boot.dev curriculum, adding new projects and exercises along the way.
