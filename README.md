# boot.dev Learning Journey

Welcome! I'm a brand new developer just starting my programming journey with [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/), an online platform focused on backend development education.

## About Me

I'm a Technical Team Leader for a SaaS company with a career background in QA. In my free time, I've been learning Docker and Kubernetes. If you're interested in that work, check out my [home-ops](https://github.com/gavinmcfall/home-ops) repo!

Now I'm taking the next step and diving into programming with Python and Go through boot.dev.

## About This Repository

This repository will contain code, exercises, and projects as I learn programming fundamentals and backend development through boot.dev's curriculum. I'm documenting my progress as I go!

## Languages I'm Learning

### Python

Python is my first programming language! I'm excited to learn:

- Core Python syntax and fundamentals
- Data structures and algorithms
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Functional programming concepts
- Working with files and data

### Go

Go (Golang) will be the next language on my learning path. Topics I'll be covering include:

- Go syntax and conventions
- Concurrency with goroutines and channels
- Building web servers and APIs
- Static typing and compilation
- Go's approach to error handling

## Course Progress

🚀 Just getting started! This repository will grow as I work through the boot.dev curriculum, adding new projects and exercises along the way.
